Refactoring
1. Added interface to all services used. When changing the codeset to use dependency injection would be simple to resgiter the services.
2. Moving all the configuations to appsettings, easy to manage and maintain

Note
1. Added the Contact Id that I recived from get response, this gives conflicting the primary key issue. 
	- As it was writing the id in csv so I just followed the same. 
	  Can we changed by not adding Id and auto genetaring it when inserting [will have duplicate records in such case]
